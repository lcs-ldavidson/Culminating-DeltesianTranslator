var testText = "When the small town of Ryvon is attacked by a force of savage undead, those not slaughtered are left suffering from a mysterious disease. The lucky few to escape the infection must now race to discover the nature of the disease and the origin of the creatures that brought it. The Archdruids - the magical religious leaders of the town - finally find the answer, but a boy and his father must decide if they are willing to risk the lives of everyone to save the person they love most."
